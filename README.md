The objective of this project is to perform word frequency analysis. 

This link provides Twitter data of Elon Musk from 2010-2022. For analysis consider the years 2017-2021 (last 5 complete years). Each year has thousands of tweets. Assume each year to be a document (all the tweets in one year will be considered as a document) 

1. Compute the term frequencies for each year. They should be normalized (scale of [0, 1]). Exclude stopwords.    
2. Show the top 10 words (for each year) by highest value of word frequency.    
3. Plot a histogram of word frequencies for each year     
4. Demonstrate Zipf’s law by plotting log-log plots of word frequencies v. rank for each year     
5. Use TF-IDF to calculate and show the 5 most “important” words for each year
